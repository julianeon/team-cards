This project was bootstrapped with create react app. It basically is me trying out Gestalt (UI components), the card component, and updating a parent component through a child component (which is what happens when you click bio). I put it together as this make believe team, with four cards.

## Comments

It was very smooth sailing until I tried to pass a function as an argument to the child, and then have the child execute it, with an argument: surprisingly difficult. This is the onClicked argument, now working.

### Ideas for Improvement

It could be put into UI containers; it could be made to work with other Gestalt components.
