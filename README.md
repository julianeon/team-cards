This project was bootstrapped with create react app. It uses Gestalt (UI components), the card component, and updates a parent component through a child component (which is what happens when you click the chat text). It's basically a remixed version of the card app I did.

## Comments

It's not very adventurous, and most of my time was spent tweaking variables sent to components in Gestalt.

### Ideas for Improvement

You could make the chat UI look better, or do something cooler with another state variable.

Or, to give more of a game sense, you could have the person choose between chat options - right now they have only one, the one in red text.
